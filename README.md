# Pint
How did you get here? Did you check my profile?
Anyway...

The Pint is my school project that I'm probably gonna abandon in ~6 months. If you're REALLY intrested in shitty graphical editors, go check it out. I do not guarantee that I will solve all the issues this project has. There are several ideas in my head that I want to implement here, but, as I said earlier, no guarantees.

Also the interface is in russian, so... good luck translating everything!
